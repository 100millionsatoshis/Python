# we use hashtag (octothorpe) to write comments inside python code, and it is not executed by python.
# we write comments to leave some note, or little reminder or line to explain a line of code
# trippe quotation mar is another way to write a comment. It is called docstrings (documentation strings)
#
'''
print("THis is comment") This is docstring. Unlike conventional comments, docstrings are retained throughout the
runtime of the program. This allows the programmer to inspect these comments at run time.  
'''

# sometimes commenting can be useful to commenting out the line out code to disable it instead of deleting.

print('Let us say this line of code causing you trouble')

# by putting hashtag in front of it you can disable it.
# print("Let's say this line of code causing you trouble")
